# Data Sources

## Purpose
This document tracks all data sources used by `quant-bot`, including APIs, feeds, and local storage formats. Every new integration should be recorded here.

---

## Current Sources
### Stocks
- **Polygon** or **Finnhub** â€” daily and intraday OHLCV bars
- Output format: CSV (stored in `/data/`)

### IPOs
- **Finnhub IPO Calendar** (upcoming listings)
- **Polygon IPO Endpoint** (historical IPO data)
- **SEC EDGAR** (S-1 filings for deeper metadata)

### Options
- **Polygon Options Chains**
- Broker APIs (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca for limited options support)

### News
- **NewsAPI** (broad news articles by ticker/company)
- **Google News RSS** (backup/free option)

---

## Storage + Logging
- Raw pulls stored as `.csv` in `/data/raw`
- Transformed/cleaned data saved as `.parquet` in `/data/processed`
- Every fetch operation logged in `/logs/data_fetch.log`

---

## To-Do
- [ ] Add credentials management (`.env`) for APIs
- [ ] Automate daily IPO fetch and append to local database
- [ ] Decide on retention: keep raw data vs. clean-only
