# 🚀 Future Development & Model Roadmap
**Quant Bot — The Next Evolution**

---

## 🧭 Purpose
Now that Quant Bot has mastered its foundation (buzz, market, baseline nowcast),  
the next step is to **experiment, iterate, and grow the intelligence layer** —  
from raw probability estimation to explainable, adaptive decision models.

This page is a living document outlining potential next directions, models to test, and reasons why they matter.

## 🌱 Phase 5 — Feature Engineering & Expansion

**Objective:** enrich the signal before upgrading the model.

| Category | New Feature Ideas | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Buzz Dynamics** | Rolling 3-day change in mentions, sentiment volatility, source diversity | Captures acceleration of attention — a strong behavioral cue |
| **Price Context** | Intraday volatility, momentum score, gap openings | Provides regime awareness (calm vs panic periods) |
| **Cross-Signals** | Lagged correlations between buzz & returns | Links information delay with real movement |
| **Macro Layer (optional)** | VIX index, 10-year yield, sector ETF drift | Helps adjust predictions for broader risk appetite |

## 🧠 Phase 6 — Model Expansion

### 1️⃣ Logistic Regression (✅ baseline)
- *Strengths:* interpretable, fast, stable.
- *Weakness:* linear; can’t capture non-linear effects.

✅ **Keep for benchmarking.**

---

### 2️⃣ Random Forest (✅ baseline)
- *Strengths:* handles non-linearities, feature interactions.
- *Weakness:* harder to interpret; static over time.

✅ **Keep for stability comparison.**

---

### 3️⃣ Gradient Boosting (📈 next logical step)
- **Candidates:** `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, `CatBoost`
- **Why:** these tree-based models handle complex interactions, missing values, and weak signals exceptionally well.
- **Goal:** push accuracy to 0.55–0.58 range without overfitting.

🧩 *Tip:* use SHAP values for interpretability — see which features truly drive predictions.

---

### 4️⃣ Temporal / Sequence Models (🕰️ intermediate goal)
- **Candidates:** `LSTM`, `Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)`, `1D CNN`
- **Why:** markets are *time-dependent*. These capture lag, memory, and regime persistence.
- **Use Case:** predicting “trend continuation vs reversal” windows rather than one-day moves.

🎯 *Target:* stability over time, not just one test period.

---

### 5️⃣ Hybrid Ensemble (🔮 advanced)
Combine:
- **Short-term signal:** boosting model (pattern detection)
- **Medium-term trend:** LSTM/TFT (context memory)
- **Buzz impact:** weighted regression (attention sentiment)

Result → *blended probability score* that adapts to different market regimes.

---

## 🧩 Phase 7 — Explainability & Visualization

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **SHAP** | Rank features by impact |
| **LIME** | Explain single predictions |
| **Plotly dashboards** | Interactive feature trends |
| **Streamlit expansions** | Visual “why did it predict ↑?” pane |

Goal: build a transparent “quant glass box,” not a black box.

---

## 🧠 Phase 8 — Continuous Learning Loop

Once your data pipeline is steady:

1. Auto-fetch new buzz daily.  
2. Auto-update market data each night.  
3. Retrain the model weekly.  
4. Generate “Daily Summary” markdown with top 5 bullish & bearish tickers.

Long-term vision:  
> *Quant Bot wakes up every morning, reads the market, and writes its thoughts.*

| 🥈 Entry | Logistic Regression | Linear baseline | ✅ Done |
| 🥈 Entry+ | Random Forest | Non-linear baseline | ✅ Done |
| 🥇 Core | LightGBM / XGBoost | Power & efficiency | 🚧 Next |
| 🥇 Core+ | LSTM / TFT | Sequential reasoning | 🧠 Later |
| 🏆 Elite | Ensemble Hybrid | Adaptive intelligence | 🌅 Long-term vision |

## 💡 Personal Note: Why This Matters

Markets aren’t magic — they’re math, emotion, and timing blended.  
The goal isn’t omniscience — it’s **understanding**.  

Every small edge you discover, every false start you debug, and every pattern you visualize brings you closer to mastering how **information turns into motion.**

Quant Bot is your playground to test that truth safely — through science, not speculation.
